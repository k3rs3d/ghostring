Each site is a doorway to the next, allowing visitors to drift through cryptic corridors of cyberspace...<p>Ghostring's <a href=https://ghostring.neocities.org/list.html>membership</a> is <b>open</b> as a vampire's coffin at midnight!<p>If you run a personal website or blog, you are welcome. I invite any readers, writers, artists, skeptics, dreamers, ghouls, ghosts, and unknown creatures...<p>Here, the moonlight is always right for sharing stories...<h2>Joining</h2><p>Your site need only be devoid of bigotry & ads, and you should be willing to add the webring links.<p>Add the following webring HTML somewhere on your site (I simply put my links in the footer):<p><code>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/<b><i>YOUR_SLUG</i></b>/previous">‚Üê&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/">Ghostring&LT/a>
<br>
&LTa href="https://ghostring.neocities.org/<b><i>YOUR_SLUG</i></b>/next">‚Üí&LT/a>
</code><p>(Replace <code>YOUR_SLUG</code> with a keyword representing your site - for example, slug <code>kersed</code> for the website <code>kersed.net</code>)<p>My webring <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>application</a> generates pages which automatically redirect visitors to the sites adjacent to each other in the list. This way, the links connect us all together in a loop!<p>It's okay if you want to customize the links - changing the arrow characters to something else, or using images/buttons instead of plain text, etc. The important thing is to allow visitors to easily find their way between sites!<h3>Updating the List</h3><p>Once you have the links on your page, there are several ways to get on the list:<ul><li><a href=https://neocities.org/site/ghostring>leave a comment on neocities</a>!<li><a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ghostring>submit a pull request</a>!<li><a href=https://hol.ogra.ph/@kern>message me on fedi</a>!</ul><h3>Required Information</h3><p>When sending your request, the only required details are your site's <b>URL</b>, and the <b>slug</b> (site keyword) that you picked. I need the slug in order to activate your links.<p>Please specify the URL where you put the links so visitors can find them. If your links are on your front page, then your normal URL will do. If your links are elsewhere on your site - like on a special "links" page - then please use that specific page as your URL.<p>That's it! If you've added the links & submitted a request, then you're all set!<h3>Optional Information</h3><p>Optionally, you can also include additional information for your site listing:<ul><li>Full <b>title</b> of your site<li>A brief <b>description</b> of your site<li>Some form of <b>contact info</b> (email, fedi, neocities, a contact page on your site, etc)<li>Your <b>RSS</b> link, if you have one</ul><p>None of the above is required; it only helps <i>flesh out</i> your entry in the <a href=https://ghostring.neocities.org/list.html>directory</a>.<h2>Updates</h2><p>Please understand it may take a few days (or more) to process any requests and update the webring!<p>The <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a> application doesn't run automatically right now. I have to run it by hand to re-generate the webring every once in a while. It's not the kind of webring software that detects changes on-the-fly, rather, it's a simple HTML generator. So if I'm busy or away from my computer for any reason, it may take some time before I can update the webring again. At the bottom of this page, there should be a timestamp showing the last time the webring was updated. In the <i>spirit</i> of the small web, thanks for your patience!<p>If your site still doesn't appear on the webring even after being added to the Ghostring list, then most likely <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a> wasn't able to automatically detect the required links on your site. This is a necessary verification step and I can't accomodate sites that omit the webring links, or sites that put them inside any dynamic content which can't be easily scraped. The links must be present in plain HTML.<p>Also, Ghostring uses a shuffle mode. Every time the webring is regenerated, the sequence is randomized. That means each update will scramble everyone's links. Some sites naturally get more traffic than others. Shuffling the webring helps balance out the traffic. So check back in on the webring once in a while to discover some cool new sites!<h2>Leaving</h2><p>If Ghostring links can't be found on your site at the time the webring is re-generated, then it won't be able to be included for that iteration of the webring. After a while, if the links don't get fixed after many attempts, I'll drop your site from the list in order to maintain the list.<p>If you want to remove yourself from the Ghostring, it'd be appreciated if you gave <a href=https://neocities.org/site/ghostring>me</a> a heads up so I can update the list! Otherwise, simply remove the links from your site. Eventually it will get removed.<h2>About This Page</h2><p><ul><li>Header font: <a href=https://www.dafont.com/gypsy-curse.font>Gypsy Curse</a> by <a href=http://www.sinisterfonts.com/>Sinister Fonts</a><li>Body font: <a href=https://www.dafont.com/imperator.font>Imperator</a> by <a href=https://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/>Paul Lloyd</a></ul><br><br><center> <img src=https://notmerlin.com/other/horrorgifs/lines/line%20(32).gif> </center><footer><small><center> <p>Updated: 2025-10-27 20:50:10</p> <p>Launched: 2024-02-04</p> <p>Powered by <a href=https://github.com/k3rs3d/ringfairy>ringfairy</a>!</p> </center></small></footer><div class=fog-container></div>
